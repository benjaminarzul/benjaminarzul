Based on TOGAF 9, which of the following is the best answer ?";"1Scenario\nScenario Please read this scenario prior to answering the Question You are serving as the Lead Architect for an enterprise architecture project team within a leading multinational pharmaceutical and medical devices manufacturer. Its brands include numerous household names for medications and first aid supplies. The company has a long history of innovating new treatments for many common illnesses and diseases. Prior to launching a new treatment, the company has to demonstrate Its effectiveness and safety in a set of clinical trials that satisfy the regulatory requirements of the countries in the target markets. All clinical trials are undertaken by its research laboratories, which employ over 10,000 people at separate facilities in the United Kingdom, United States, Sweden, France, Canada, India, China and Japan. In addition to internal research and development activities the company is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. The Enterprise Architecture group within the company has been engaged in an architecture development project to create a secure networked collaboration system that will allow researchers at its product development laboratories worldwide to share information about their clinical trials. This system will also connect with external partners. The Enterprise Architecture group within the company has been engaged in an architecture development project to create a secure networked collaboration system that will allow researchers at its product development laboratories worldwide to share information about their clinical trials. This system will also connect with external partners. The Enterprise Architecture group is a mature organization. They use the TOGAF 9 ADM with extensions required to support current good manufacturing practices and good laboratory practices in their target markets. Due to the highly sensitive nature of the information that is managed, special care was taken to ensure that each architecture domain included an examination of the security and privacy issues that are relevant. The Executive Vice President for Clinical Research is the sponsor of the Enterprise Architecture activity.
