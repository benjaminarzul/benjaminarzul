1;"A - Determine the set of Solution Building Blocks required by identifying which Solution Building Blocks need to be developed and which need to be procured. Eliminate any duplicate building blocks. Group the remaining Solution Building Blocks together to create the work packages using a CRUD matrix. Rank the work packages in terms of cost and select the most cost-effective options for inclusion in a series of Transition Architectures. Schedule the roll out of the work packages to be sequential across the geographic regions.";1;1
2;"B - Create an Implementation Factor Assessment and Deduction Matrix and a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions and Dependencies Matrix. For each gap, identify a proposed solution and classify it as new development, purchased solution, or based on an existing product. Group similar solutions together to form work packages. Identify dependencies between work packages factoring in the clinical trial schedules. Regroup the packages into a set of Capability Increments scheduled into a series of Transition Architectures.";2;1
3;"D - Group the Solution Building Blocks from a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions and Dependencies Matrix into a set of work packages. Using the matrix as a planning tool, regroup the work packages to account for dependencies. Sequence the work packages into the Capability Increments needed to achieve the Target Architecture. Schedule the rollout one region at a time. Document the progression of the enterprise architecture using a state evolution table.";4;1
4;"C - Use a Consolidated Gaps, Solutions and Dependencies Matrix as a planning tool. For each gap classify whether the solution is either a new development, purchased solution, or based on an existing product. Group the similar solutions together to define the work packages. Regroup the work packages into a set of Capability Increments to transition to the Target Architecture taking into account the schedule for clinical trials.";3;1
